                Hello my name is Praveen Kandasamy and I am excited to be taking this Software Engineering course this fall. I am currently a junior studying computer engineering major here at San Jose State and have interest in computer systems, robotics, project development, along with some web application development. Some of my hobbies and interests include playing basketball, volleyball, poker, along with cooking and gyming. I can almost bench 185.

            <p style="text-align: center;">I have aspirations to be a future software and computer engineer hopefully working to make a legitamate impact on our society. Currently I am not exactly sure what specific division of software/computer engineering I would like to work with as I have interests and experience in a wide variety of divisions. One thing I can confidently say is that I am motivated with my projects and work if they have a meaningful impact and if I can directly see the benefits the applications of the project will reap. I look forward to continuing my journey of learning, experimenting, and meeting new people from diverse backgrounds.</p>
